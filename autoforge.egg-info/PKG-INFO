# AutoForge

AutoForge is an **educational machine learning library written from scratch in Python**.  
It is designed to help beginners and curious developers understand **how machine learning algorithms work internally**, rather than treating them as black boxes.

AutoForge prioritizes **clarity, readability, and learning** over performance or production readiness.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Most machine learning libraries focus on usability and speed, hiding internal mechanics.  
AutoForge takes the opposite approach:

- Implements algorithms **from scratch**
- Exposes training logic clearly
- Uses simple, readable code
- Helps learners understand **what happens during training**

This project exists primarily as a **learning tool**.

---

## 👥 Who Is This For?

### AutoForge is for:
- Beginners learning machine learning fundamentals
- Students who want to re-implement algorithms themselves
- Developers curious about how libraries like scikit-learn work internally
- Anyone who prefers learning by reading and modifying code

### AutoForge is NOT for:
- Production use
- Large-scale or high-performance training
- Replacing scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow
- Enterprise or deployment-ready systems

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Educational first** – clarity over optimization  
- **Minimal abstraction** – no unnecessary layers  
- **From scratch** – core logic implemented manually  
- **Sklearn-inspired API** – familiar, but not compatible  

> The API may resemble scikit-learn, but this library is **not a drop-in replacement**.

## 📦 Installation

Clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIDHUNGRAJ/autoforge.git
cd autoforge
pip install -e .
```

## 🛠️ Example Usage

Linear Regression

```python
from autoforge.linear_model import LinearRegression
from autoforge.metrics import mean_squared_error, root_mean_squared_error
import numpy as np

# X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 4], [5, 6], [ 7, 8], [9, 10]])

X = np.array([[1], [4], [3], [5], [7], [10]])

y = np.array([30, 35, 37, 45, 49, 52])

model = LinearRegression()

model.fit(X, y)

y_pred = model.predict(X)

print(f"MSE: {mean_squared_error(y, y_pred)}")

```
